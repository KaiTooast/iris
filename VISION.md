# Vision – I.R.I.S.

I.R.I.S. exists to prove one thing:

> **AI image generation does not belong exclusively to corporations.**

---

## 🌍 The Problem

Most AI platforms:
- Lock users into subscriptions
- Hide implementation details
- Require cloud dependency
- Limit customization

---

## 🌱 Our Vision

I.R.I.S. is a **reference architecture**, not a walled product.

- Anyone can run it
- Anyone can modify it
- Anyone can scale it
- Anyone can learn from it

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

- Local-first
- Open by default
- Hardware-agnostic
- Community-driven

---

## 🚀 The Long-Term Goal

To become the **foundation layer** upon which:
- Individuals
- Studios
- Researchers
- Communities

build their own AI image ecosystems.

---

I.R.I.S. is not finished.
It is **alive**.
